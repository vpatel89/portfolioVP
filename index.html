				<p>I started my main educational experience at Wayne State University where I was studying to become a Physical Therapist, an Engineer, a Pathologist Assistant, among many other things. The problem was that I had vast range of interests; From video games to robotics, psychology to physics, I was conflicted, as many students are, as to what the “best direction” for me was. Because of this I ended up taking quite a variety of classes, most of which were science-based. I ultimately decided to graduate with a Bachelor’s Degree in Psychology.</p>
				<p>After graduating, I moved back to New York where I immediately began to look for a job. I had to make up for all the money I spent on school after all. Due to the help of a friend, I landed a job as an Accessioner at Cordant Health Solutions, formerly called AFTS Labs. In the accessioning department we basically receive and handle specimen and prepare them for testing, which includes aliquoting the specimen, and entering tests, medication, and patient information into our LIMS interface. I got promoted fairly quickly to a Lead Trainer, where I was in charge of training all of the new employees in the department. Only a couple months after that I was promoted to my current title as Accessioning Team Lead. My responsibilities grew from simply accessioning specimen to managing a department of 8 to 10 employees.</p>
				<p>Eventually, I simply became bored of my job. Not that I didn’t like the laboratory setting or even managing/helping my fellow employees; I just feel that I have nothing to gain and my growth has completely stopped. Being the knowledge-hungry individual that I am, this is unacceptable. I finally realized that I needed a career that is constantly growing and changing so that I can adapt and grow along with it. This is why I seek to become a full-time developer.</p>
